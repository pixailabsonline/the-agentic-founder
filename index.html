            <p class="typing-container"><span id="animated-text"></span><span id="typing-cursor"></span></p>
            <p>The old founder model is broken. Team bloat, endless meetings, investor optics, and shallow automation disguised as progress. We're done with that.</p>
            <p>The Agentic Founder is a new archetype: a solo builder who replaces headcount with precision-engineered systems. Using AI agents, modular stacks, and belief-driven execution, Agentic Founders don't chase permission - they build proof.</p>

            <h2>From Solo Builder to Agentic Founder</h2>
            <p>I'm not theorizing this. I'm living it.</p>
            <p>Every day I use tools like Cursor, Roo Code, and Sparc to build real products - solo. No team, no VAs, no fluff. Just compound leverage through systems I design and own.</p>
            <p>The playbook I'm following is simple:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Build the system once</li>
                <li>Automate what used to require people</li>
                <li>Let belief + execution speak louder than pitch decks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And now I'm making it public.</p>

            <h2>What Is an Agentic Founder?</h2>
            <p>An Agentic Founder is not a solo founder. They're a system-led founder.</p>
            <p>They build:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Without asking for permission</li>
                <li>Without hiring by default</li>
                <li>Without outsourcing their judgment</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They use tools like Gemini Pro, Roo Code, Cursor, and Claude - not just to automate tasks, but to build out entire workflows, GTM plans, codebases, and customer journeys.</p>
            <p>This is how one founder delivers the output of ten without losing clarity or control.</p>

            <h2>The Agentic Stack</h2>
            <p>This isn't a stack. It's a strategy.</p>
            <p>These are the core systems I use every day:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cursor – Code Amplifier:</strong> Fast, intelligent code generation + refactoring</li>
                <li><strong>Roo Code – Build Automation Layer:</strong> Ship working MVPs using reusable patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Claude / Gemini Pro – Thought Extension:</strong> Strategic reasoning, copywriting, product planning</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each one is designed to execute — not distract. These agents don't think for me. They move when I do.</p>

            <h2>The £100K in 180 Days Challenge</h2>
            <p>Can one founder generate £100K in 180 days — without hires, fluff, or traditional scale?</p>
            <p>That's the challenge I'm living. Publicly.</p>
            <p>No team. No VA. No shortcuts.<br>Just conviction and compounding systems.</p>
            <p>I'm sharing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Weekly breakdowns of what I'm building</li>
                <li>System flows and automations</li>
                <!-- <li>Revenue progress and friction points</li> -->

            <p>Not everyone wants to figure it out alone.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You bring the idea and intent.</li>
                <li>I help you ship a real product using the same systems I use every day.</li>
