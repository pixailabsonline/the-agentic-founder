The Agentic Founder

While the world races to make AI more agentic, we’re focused on what matters more: making the founder unreasonably agentic.

The old founder model is broken. Team bloat, endless meetings, investor optics, and shallow automation disguised as progress. We're done with that.

The Agentic Founder is a new archetype: a solo builder who replaces headcount with precision-engineered systems. Using AI agents, modular stacks, and belief-driven execution, Agentic Founders don’t chase permission - they build proof.

From Solo Builder to Agentic Founder

I'm not theorizing this. I’m living it.

Every day I use tools like Cursor, Roo Code, and Sparc to build real products - solo. No team, no VAs, no fluff. Just compound leverage through systems I design and own.

The playbook I’m following is simple:

Build the system once

Automate what used to require people

Let belief + execution speak louder than pitch decks

And now I’m making it public.

What Is an Agentic Founder?

An Agentic Founder is not a solo founder. They’re a system-led founder.

They build:

Without asking for permission

Without hiring by default

Without outsourcing their judgment

They use tools like Gemini Pro, Roo Code, Cursor, and Claude - not just to automate tasks, but to build out entire workflows, GTM plans, codebases, and customer journeys.

This is how one founder delivers the output of ten  without losing clarity or control.

The Agentic Stack

This isn’t a stack. It’s a strategy.

These are the core systems I use every day:

Cursor – Code Amplifier: Fast, intelligent code generation + refactoring

Roo Code – Build Automation Layer: Ship working MVPs using reusable patterns

Claude / Gemini Pro – Thought Extension: Strategic reasoning, copywriting, product planning



Each one is designed to execute — not distract. These agents don’t think for me. They move when I do.

The £100K in 180 Days Challenge

Can one founder generate £100K in 180 days — without hires, fluff, or traditional scale?

That’s the challenge I’m living. Publicly.

No team. No VA. No shortcuts.
Just conviction and compounding systems.

I’m sharing:

Weekly breakdowns of what I’m building

System flows and automations

Revenue progress and friction points

Follow the journey or join me. If you believe what I believe, this isn’t a gimmick — it’s a proving ground.

The Agentic Launchpath

Not everyone wants to figure it out alone.

For founders who have the conviction but want help building the right way, I offer a limited support path:

You bring the idea and intent.

I help you ship a real product using the same systems I use every day.

No equity. No bloat. Just honest execution.

If you're ready to stop learning and start proving, this is your next step.
